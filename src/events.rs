//! What Kova pushes to its IPC subscribers, and when.
//!
//! There is no single callback to hang these off. Focus moves from a dozen
//! places (keyboard navigation, a click, the pane switcher, `focus-pane`,
//! closing a pane, switching tab or window), and `working` / `awaiting` are
//! *derived* from the pane's title and a pushed flag rather than set in one
//! spot. Instrumenting every mutation site would mean missing one. So this
//! module keeps the last published state and diffs it on the render tick:
//! one place to get right, and nothing can change behind its back.
//!
//! Cost discipline, because this runs inside the render loop:
//! - nobody subscribed → one relaxed atomic load and we are done;
//! - focus is compared on every tick, but that is two `RefCell` reads;
//! - the full pane sweep is throttled to ~4 Hz (`pane_poll_interval`);
//! - the expensive JSON (a `proc_pidinfo` for the CWD, a process-table walk)
//!   is built only when an edge actually fired.
